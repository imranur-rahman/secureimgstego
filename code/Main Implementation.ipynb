Commonly, steganography is used to unobtrusively hide a small message within the noisy regions of a larger image. In this study, we attempt to place a full size color image within another image of the same size. Deep neural networks are simultaneously trained to create the hiding and revealing processes and are designed to specifically work as a pair. The system is trained on images drawn randomly from the ImageNet database, and works well on natural images from a wide variety of sources. Beyond demonstrating the successful application of deep learning to hiding images, we carefully examine how the result is achieved and explore extensions. Unlike many popular steganographic methods that encode the secret message within the least significant bits of the carrier image, our approach compresses and distributes the secret image's representation across all of the available bits."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"T2n2sOYXuPIh","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1610450810166,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":1774,"user":{"displayName":"Deep Steganography","photoUrl":"","userId":"17444086891419800955"}},"outputId":"0209c28a-ff15-4afa-a7f1-bed99bdcbf85"},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hnB61EywuXSb"},"source":["!unzip -q \"/content/drive/My Drive/data/tiny-imagenet-200.zip\""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7hjOmp_RcYKz"},"source":["### Imports ###\n","from keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint, LearningRateScheduler, TensorBoard\n","from keras.engine.topology import Network\n","from keras.layers import *\n","from keras.models import Model\n","from keras.preprocessing import image\n","import keras.backend as K\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import os\n","import random\n","import scipy.misc\n","from tqdm import *\n","\n","%matplotlib inline"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1aaZX_11cYLA"},"source":["## Config"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"tJmgrNwvcYLC"},"source":["### Constants ###\n","DATA_DIR = \"/content/tiny-imagenet-200\"\n","TRAIN_DIR = os.path.join(DATA_DIR, \"train\")\n","TEST_DIR = os.path.join(DATA_DIR, \"test\")\n","\n","IMG_SHAPE = (64, 64)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pGcfUooVcYLL"},"source":["## Dataset creation\n","The Dataset we used is Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge.

Its goal is to be able to encode information about the secret image S into the cover image C, generating C' that closely resembles C, while still being able to decode information from C' to generate the decoded secret image S', which should resemble S as closely as possible.\n","\n","The Preparation Network has the responsibility of preparing data from the secret image to be concatenated with the cover image and fed to the Hiding Network. The Hiding Network than transforms that input into the encoded cover image C'. Finally, the Reveal Network decodes the secret image S' from C'. For stability, we add noise before the Reveal Network, as suggested by the paper. Although the author of the paper didn't originally specify the architecture of the three networks, we discovered aggregated layers showed good results. For both the Hiding and Reveal networks, we use 5 layers of 65 filters (50 3x3 filters, 10 4x4 filters and 5 5x5 filters).
